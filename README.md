# What is moadian API?


## Using

We need to follow 3 steps until connecting and sending a test request to Moadian webservice.

1- First step is to get nonce token which is a random token that is valid from 10s up to 200s. (You have short time to use this token and do your job, so max is 200s and min is 10s and default is 30s)
2- Second step is to use your certificate, private key, etc to mix nonce token with your keys to generate a JWS. JWS is different form JWT. we are going to use JWS token in the future requets in header.
3- Now everything is done, and you can use the token in your requests. for example here we are just going to send a test request to fetch server information from Moadian tax.gov.ir API webservice.

We created 3 seperate php files to show things step by step and easy to read and follow steps.

Commands to run the test:
```bash
$ php nonce.php
$ php jws.php
$ php server-information.php
```

Before running the script, you need to make sure you filled your key in `jws.php` file and you have your private, public, certificate key files in the current root path.

8- If you want to test it by a third-party online service, here is an online accounting software at https://moadian.finto.ir.

Also it's possible to create a new private key, public key, csr in https://moadian.finto.ir platform, but in this case you will not have certificate file and you cannot connect to Moadian API directly by your custom platform or API/Code. but it will works and this platform will connect to your TAX account properly.

Here are steps for creating a new private/public/csr file:
